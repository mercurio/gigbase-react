Loader used to initialize the database from prehistoric data.

This is the version for the Hasura server on Heroku. It loaded all
of the songs without skipping any (unlike, for example, the graphcool loader).

To run use ./run, after copying songs.csv.sav to songs.csv. Edit songs.csv
for a partial load.
